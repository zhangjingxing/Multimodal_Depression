Our member's dataset is available at the following link: [Member's Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JVjIpI5qkC1u6QsoWpQyDSS7b-jpiCUV?usp=drive_link).

**Note :**

The data is provided in its **raw format** (.wav and .txt files) and has undergone preprocessing to remove the interviewerâ€™s audio and presence. However, while the transcript data has been initially processed, the ratings have not yet been generated. Feel free to use the ChatGPT custom prompt to create ratings for the transcript feature data.
